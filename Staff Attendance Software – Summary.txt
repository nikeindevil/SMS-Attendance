Staff Attendance Software – Summary
Purpose:
Automates staff attendance tracking via SMS using Google Sheets, Apps Script, and MacroDroid.

Key Features
Staff Registry:

A dedicated Staff sheet holds each staff member’s name and phone number.
Only SMS from registered numbers are processed; others are ignored.
Attendance Actions:

Staff mark attendance by sending SMS with actions: IN, OUT, BREAK IN, BREAK OUT.
MacroDroid forwards each SMS to a Google Apps Script Web App.
Break Management:

Breaks are logged in real time.
Only one open break at a time is allowed per staff.
Staff must close breaks before marking OUT.
Error Handling & Feedback:

Invalid actions (e.g., OUT with open break, multiple breaks) are logged to a Logs sheet.
Staff receive immediate SMS feedback on errors or ignored actions.
Attendance Sheets:

Monthly attendance is tracked in dynamically created Monthly-YYYY-MM sheets.
Each row shows IN time, OUT time, total break minutes, and net working hours.
All times and durations are displayed in HH:MM format.
Supervisor Controls:

Supervisors can manually edit attendance records (e.g., missed OUT) in the Google Sheet.
Security & Privacy:

Only registered staff numbers can log attendance.
Raw logs and error logs are protected.
Workflow
Staff sends an attendance SMS.
MacroDroid forwards SMS to the script Web App.
Script checks if the sender is registered.
If not, SMS is ignored.
If yes, attendance is processed; errors are logged and staff are notified via SMS.
All attendance data is updated in Google Sheets for review and reporting.
Tech Stack:

Google Sheets (data store)
Google Apps Script (business logic/webhook)
MacroDroid (mobile automation, SMS → webhook + SMS feedback)
